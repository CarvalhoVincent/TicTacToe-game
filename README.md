## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- **Bonus 1**: Save the game state in the browser so that it’s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- **Bonus 2**: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it’s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Minimax algorythm


### What I learned

I learned to use SVGs differently than I usually do with the img tag, so I can change colors easily. I also learned to better understand arrays and manipulate them to find the results needed to check for victory for this game. I used promises and "async await" for the first time. I discovered the Minimax algorithm to make the computer smarter so it plays the best moves.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to progress in javascript because I think that even if my code works it is not optimized.
